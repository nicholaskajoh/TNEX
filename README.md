# TNEX [WIP]
TNEX is a program that can drive a vehicle in the [CARLA simulator](https://carla.org). It employs similar techniques used in state-of-the-art self-driving cars, howbeit with much simpler algorithms. The goal is to build an autonomous vehicle that can successfully traverse a road network to get from one point to another, and to learn how driverless cars work by having a feel for what it takes to build one.

TNEX consists of 2 parts:
- __Driver:__ Code that runs on the car for sensing, processing and actuation.
- __Mission Control:__ Web-based UI and server for inspecting telemetry and sending commands to the vehicle.
