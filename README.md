# Autonomous RC Car (WIP)
An AI agent that can drive an RC car. It employs the same techniques used in real state-of-the-art self-driving cars howbeit with much simpler algorithms and hardware components.

## Systems
- Driver (agent)
- Cartesian (Local Positioning System)
- Map (road network where vehicle will drive)
- Traffic Light Control
- Jaywalker (road-crossing pedestrian)
- Command Center (gives vehicle instructions and visualizes what it is doing)
