# TNEX
TNEX is a Python program that can drive a vehicle in the [CARLA simulator](https://carla.org). It employs similar techniques used in state-of-the-art self-driving cars, howbeit with simpler algorithms. The goal of this project is to learn how autonomous vehicles work by building one.

## Features
### Cruise Control
TNEX controls the motion of the ego vehicle along its longitudinal axis (i.e gas and brakes) using [PID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller) while lateral control (steering) is done manually.
