# TNEX [WIP]
TNEX is a program that can drive a vehicle in the [CARLA simulator](https://carla.org). It employs similar techniques used in state-of-the-art self-driving cars, howbeit with much simpler algorithms. The goal is to build a robocar that can successfully traverse a road network to get from one point to another, and to learn how driverless cars work by having a feel for what it takes to build one.

## Software
- __Vehicle:__ Code that runs on the car for sensing, processing and actuation.
- __Command Center:__ Web UI and server for inspecting telemetry and sending commands to the vehicle.
